	<h1>VIRUS AND ANTIVIROS SOFTWARE</h1>
    <img src=   "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ksrEN9M9SvEx7b6TZJvP5U-970-80.jpg.webp">
	<p>Sometimes it feels heartening to know that antivirus providers are out there fighting the good fight -
	constantly updating their internet security software packages to protect against ever-increasing threats to your online life. 
	The best antivirus choices combine watertight virus protection,
	extra features to keep you safe from scams, and are an absolute doddle to install and use.<br>
	<br>
	If you’re looking for all-round protection against the latest cyber threats, then investing in the strongest software is the best solution you can hope for
	- and we also have the best business antivirus plans if you're looking to take care of your company computers. 
	That doesn't mean you have to start spending big money either, as our guide also gives you the cheapest available prices for the top software.<br>
	<br>
	And if it's free antivirus that you're after, we have some top recommendations for you, too. 
	But considering some of the best antivirus providers out there cost less than $10 / £10 / AU$20 per year, 
	we’d always recommend playing it safe and going for a premium package.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>TOP 3 ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE</h2>
	<ol>
	<li><strong> Bitdefender - the world's very best antivirus</strong></li>
	You may be more familiar with names such as Norton, McAfee and AVG – but at the moment, we think Bitdefender is the best antivirus available. It combines watertight security 
	tools with an array of other excellent security features. It’s also really easy to use and, best of all, offers extremely good value for money.<br>
	<li><strong> Norton - great protection with useful features that won't slow you down</strong></li>
	t's a name almost synonymous with the word 'antivirus', and Norton didn't disappoint when it came to our testing. 
	As well as the kind of malware prevention you'd expect, the extra features packaged in really add value , too.<br>
	<li><strong> Kaspersky - no-nonsense suite with top-notch security</strong></li>
	It may not have quite the feature set that the above providers offer, but Kaspersky really does the basics brilliantly. <br>
	Its outright virus defence is airtight and we like that even its entry-level plan offers protection covering multiple devices.<br>
