      <p> Accessibility is an issue treated and considered prominently in both national 
      and international levels. This led to the creation of a number of resources to specify 
      the characteristics which must meet the content available through Internet Web technologies, 
      Intranets and other computer networks, so that they may be used by most people, including persons with disabilities
      and elderly persons, independently or through the technical aids pertinentes
      .</P>
