    <h3><strong>INTERNET SECURITY</strong></h3><br>
    <br>
    <h2><em>WHAT IS ABOUT?</em></h2>
    <p> Internet security consists of a range of security tactics for protecting activities 
     and transactions conducted online over the internet. 
     These tactics are meant to safeguard users from threats such as hacking into computer systems, 
    email addresses, or websites; malicious software that can infect and inherently damage systems; 
    and identity theft by hackers who steal personal data such as bank account information and credit card numbers.
    Internet security is a specific aspect of broader concepts such as cybersecurity and computer security,
    being focused on the specific threats 
    and vulnerabilities of online access and use of the internet.</p><br>
    <br>
    <h2><em>Difference between Active Attack and Passive Attack</em></h2>
    <p1>Active and Passive Attacks are security attacks. In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content
    of the messages. 
    Whereas in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for 
    malicious purposes.<p1><br>

			<td>In Active Attack, information is modified.</td>

			<td>Active Attack is dangerous for Integrity as well as Availability.</td>
			<td>Passive Attack is dangerous for Confidentiality.</td>

		    <td>Attention</td>
			<td>Attention is to be paid on detection.</td>
			<td>Attention is to be paid on prevention.</td>

	 <ul>
	    <li><strong>DEFINITION</strong></li><br>
		<p45>Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, 
		trojans and other harmful computer programs
		hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information.<br>
		In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, 
		rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.<p45><br>
		<br>
		<li><strong>TYPE OF MALWARE</strong></li><br>
		they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:<br>
		 
		<ol>
		<li>A <p5><em>worm</em></p5> is a standalone piece of malicious software
		that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.</li>
		<li>A<p5><em> virus</em></p5> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, 
		then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.</li>
		<li>A <p5><em>trojan</em></p5> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something 
		the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.</li>
		</ol><br>
		<br>
		<li><strong>HOW TO PREVENT MALWARE</strong></li><br>
	    With spam and phishing email being the primary vector by which malware infects computers, 
		the best way to prevent malware is make sure your email systems are locked down tight—and your users know 
		how to spot danger. We recommend a combination of carefully checking attached documents and restricting
		potentially 
		dangerous user behavior—as well as just familiarizing your users with common phishing scams 
		so that their common sense can kick in.<br>
        When it comes to more technical preventative measures,
        there are a number of steps you can take, including keeping all your systems patched and updated, 
        keeping an inventory of hardware so you know what you need to protect, and performing 
        continuous vulnerability assessments on your infrastructure.<br>
        When it comes to ransomware attacks in particular,
        one way to be prepared is to always make backups of your files, ensuring
        that you'll never need to pay a ransom
        to get them back if your hard drive is encrypted.<br> 
		<br>
		<li><strong>MALWARE PROTECTION</strong></li><br>
		<p6>Antivirus software is the most widely known product in the category of malware protection products; 
		despite "virus" being in the name, most offerings take on all forms of malware.
		While high-end security pros dismiss it as obsolete, it's still the backbone of basic
		anti-malware defense. <p6>Today's best antivirus software is from vendors Kaspersky Lab, 
		Symantec and Trend Micro, according to recent tests by AV-TEST.</p6><br>
		<br>
		When it comes to more advanced corporate networks, <em>endpoint security</em> offerings provide defense in depth against malware. They provide not only the signature-based malware detection that you expect from antivirus, but anti-spyware, personal firewall, application control and other styles of host intrusion prevention. Gartner offers a list of its top picks in this space,
		which include products from Cylance, CrowdStrike, and Carbon Black. 
		<h4><em>WHAT IS NETWORK SECURITY</em></h4>
		Network Security protects your network and data from breaches, intrusions and other threats. 
		This is a vast and overarching term that describes hardware and software solutions as well as processes or <br>
		rules and configurations relating to network use, accessibility, and overall threat protection.<br>
