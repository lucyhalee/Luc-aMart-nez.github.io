    <h1> ACCESIBILITY STANDARS </h1>

    <h2><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></h2>

      <p>Accessibility is an issue treated and considered prominently in both national 
      and international levels. This led to the creation of a number of resources to specify 
      the characteristics which must meet the content available through Internet Web technologies, 
      Intranets and other computer networks, so that they may be used by most people, including persons with disabilities
      and elderly persons, independently or through the technical aids pertinentes
      .</P>
    <h3><em>W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</em></h3>

    <p> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the original set of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0) in 1998. 
	An updated version, WCAG 2.0, was published in 2008, and includes 62 success criteria, organized under four general principles:<br>
     <ul>
    <il><strong>Perceivable</strong> – Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</il><br>
    <il><strong>Operable</strong>– User interface components and navigation must be operable.</il><br>
	<il><strong>Understandable</strong> – Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</il><br>
	<il><strong>Robust</strong> – Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, 
	including assistive technologies.</il><br>
     
	
	<h4><em>What is WCAG?</em></h3><br>
	
	<P1>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is an internationally recognised standard created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br>
	The purpose of the WCAG standard is to define how to “… make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range 
	of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines
	cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. 
	These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older
	individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.”<br>
	<strong>Which WCAG applies to my mainstream organisation?</strong><br>
	There are currently two supported versions of the web accessibility standard – WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. As such, it can be confusing to determine which one
	your mainstream organisation should consider.
    The choice between WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 will largely come down to an organisation’s policy position, time and budget. 
    Given that WCAG 2.1 contains everything in WCAG 2.0 plus some extra guidance for users of mobile devices,
    a good default position is to implement WCAG 
    2.1 knowing that you have covered all the requirements for both desktop and mobile web accessibility.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Overview</strong><br>
	Regardless of whether you choose to implement WCAG 2.0 or 2.1, 
	the good news is that both guidelines use the same terminology. The guidelines are separated into the following parts:<br>
	<ol>
	<il><strong>Design principles:</strong> The four overarching principles of accessible website development.</il>
    <il><strong>Guidelines:</strong> short statements providing guidance on what should be considered by designers and developers to make a website accessible.</il>
    <il><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> Specific technical requirements to ensure that a website is compliant with the standard.</il>
	<strong>Guidelines:</strong><br>
 Sitting underneath the four POUR principles are a series of guidelines.<br>
 For WCAG 2.0 there are twelve guidelines. For WCAG 2.1 there is one additional guideline taking the total to thirteen.</p1>
 
 <h5><em>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</em></h5> 
 <p1>The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together people from industry, 
 disability organizations, government, and research labs from around the 
 world to develop guidelines and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with auditory, 
 cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities<br>
 <strong>WAI's coverage of web accessibility includes:</strong><br>
 <ol>
 <il>"web content" - websites and web applications</il>
 <il>authoring tools, such as content management systems (CMS) and blog software</il>
 <il>browsers and other "user agents"</il>
 <il>WAI-ARIA specification for accessible rich Internet applications</il>
