    <h1> ACCESIBILITY STANDARS </h1>

    <h2><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></h2>

      <p>Accessibility is an issue treated and considered prominently in both national 
      and international levels. This led to the creation of a number of resources to specify 
      the characteristics which must meet the content available through Internet Web technologies, 
      Intranets and other computer networks, so that they may be used by most people, including persons with disabilities
      and elderly persons, independently or through the technical aids pertinentes
      .</P>
    <h3><em>W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</em></h3>

    <p> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the original set of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0) in 1998. 
	An updated version, WCAG 2.0, was published in 2008, and includes 62 success criteria, organized under four general principles:<br>
     <ul>
    <il><strong>Perceivable</strong> – Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</il><br>
    <il><strong>Operable</strong>– User interface components and navigation must be operable.</il><br>
	<il><strong>Understandable</strong> – Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</il><br>
	<il><strong>Robust</strong> – Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, 
	including assistive technologies.</il><br>
     
	
	<h4><em>What is WCAG?</em></h4><br>
	
	<p1>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is an internationally recognised standard created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br>
	The purpose of the WCAG standard is to define how to “… make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range 
	of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines
	cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. 
	These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older
	individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.”<br>
	<strong>Which WCAG applies to my mainstream organisation?</strong><br>
	There are currently two supported versions of the web accessibility standard – WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. As such, it can be confusing to determine which one
	your mainstream organisation should consider.
    The choice between WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 will largely come down to an organisation’s policy position, time and budget. 
    Given that WCAG 2.1 contains everything in WCAG 2.0 plus some extra guidance for users of mobile devices,
    a good default position is to implement WCAG 
    2.1 knowing that you have covered all the requirements for both desktop and mobile web accessibility.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Overview</strong><br>
	Regardless of whether you choose to implement WCAG 2.0 or 2.1, 
	the good news is that both guidelines use the same terminology. The guidelines are separated into the following parts:<br>
	<ol>
	<il><strong>Design principles:</strong> The four overarching principles of accessible website development.</il>
    <il><strong>Guidelines:</strong> short statements providing guidance on what should be considered by designers and developers to make a website accessible.</il>
    <il><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> Specific technical requirements to ensure that a website is compliant with the standard.</il>
	<strong>Guidelines:</strong><br>
 Sitting underneath the four POUR principles are a series of guidelines.<br>
 For WCAG 2.0 there are twelve guidelines. For WCAG 2.1 there is one additional guideline taking the total to thirteen.</p1>
 
 <h5><em>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</em></h5> 
 <p2>The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together people from industry, 
 disability organizations, government, and research labs from around the 
 world to develop guidelines and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with auditory, 
 cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities<br>
 <strong>WAI's coverage of web accessibility includes:</strong><br>
 <ol>
 <il>"web content" - websites and web applications</il>
 <il>authoring tools, such as content management systems (CMS) and blog software</il>
 <il>browsers and other "user agents"</il>
 <il>WAI-ARIA specification for accessible rich Internet applications</il>

    <h1><strong>WHAT IS ABOUT?</strong></h1>
  <p> Internet security consists of a range of security tactics for protecting activities 
   and transactions conducted online over the internet. 
   These tactics are meant to safeguard users from threats such as hacking into computer systems, 
   email addresses, or websites; malicious software that can infect and inherently damage systems; 
   and identity theft by hackers who steal personal data such as bank account information and credit card numbers.
   Internet security is a specific aspect of broader concepts such as cybersecurity and computer security,
   being focused on the specific threats 
   and vulnerabilities of online access and use of the internet.</p><br>
   <br>
   <h2><em>Difference between Active Attack and Passive Attack</em></h2>
   <p1>Active and Passive Attacks are security attacks. In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content
   of the messages. 
   Whereas in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for 
   malicious purposes.<p1><br>

	  <h3><em>MALWARE</em></h3>

	 <ul>
	    <li><strong>DEFINITION</strong></li><br>
		Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, 
		trojans and other harmful computer programs
		hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information.<br>
		In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, 
		rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.<br>
		<br>
		<li><strong>TYPE OF MALWARE</strong></li><br>
		they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:<br>
		 
		<ol>
		<li>A <p5><em>worm</em></p5> is a standalone piece of malicious software
		that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.</li>
		<li>A<p5><em> virus</em></p5> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, 
		then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.</li>
		<li>A <p5><em>trojan</em></p5> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something 
		the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.</li>
		</ol><br>
		<br>
		<li><strong>HOW TO PREVENT MALWARE</strong></li><br>
		<p45>With spam and phishing email being the primary vector by which malware infects computers, 
		the best way to prevent malware is make sure your email systems are locked down tight—and your users know 
		how to spot danger. We recommend a combination of carefully checking attached documents and restricting
		potentially 
		dangerous user behavior—as well as just familiarizing your users with common phishing scams 
		so that their common sense can kick in.<br>
        When it comes to more technical preventative measures,
        there are a number of steps you can take, including keeping all your systems patched and updated, 
        keeping an inventory of hardware so you know what you need to protect, and performing 
        continuous vulnerability assessments on your infrastructure.<br>
        When it comes to ransomware attacks in particular,
        one way to be prepared is to always make backups of your files, ensuring
        that you'll never need to pay a ransom
        to get them back if your hard drive is encrypted.<br></p45>
		<br>
		<li><strong>MALWARE PROTECTION</strong></li><br>
		<p45>Antivirus software is the most widely known product in the category of malware protection products; 
		despite "virus" being in the name, most offerings take on all forms of malware.
		While high-end security pros dismiss it as obsolete, it's still the backbone of basic
		anti-malware defense. <p6>Today's best antivirus software is from vendors Kaspersky Lab, 
		Symantec and Trend Micro, according to recent tests by AV-TEST.</p6><br>
		<br>
		When it comes to more advanced corporate networks, <em>endpoint security</em> offerings provide defense in depth against malware. They provide not only the signature-based malware detection that you expect from antivirus, but anti-spyware, personal firewall, application control and other styles of host intrusion prevention. Gartner offers a list of its top picks in this space,
		which include products from Cylance, CrowdStrike, and Carbon Black.</p45>
