	<h1>APLICATION SECURITY </h1>
    <img src=   "https://avinetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/application-security-diagram.png ">
	<p>Application security describes security measures at the application level that aim to prevent data or code within the app from being stolen or hijacked.<br>
	It encompasses the security considerations
	that happen during application development and design, but it also involves systems and approaches to protect apps after they get deployed.</p>
	<p>Application security is important because today’s applications are often available over various networks and connected to the cloud, 
	 increasing vulnerabilities to security threats and breaches. There is increasing pressure and incentive to not only ensure security <br>
	 at the network level but also within applications themselves. One reason for this is because hackers are going after apps with 
	 their attacks more today than in the past. Application security testing can reveal weaknesses at the application level, helping to prevent these attacks.</p>
	<h1><em>Types of application security</em></h1>
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Authentication</strong></li>
	hen software developers build procedures into an application to ensure that only authorized users gain access to it.
	Authentication procedures ensure that a user is who they say they are. This can be accomplished by requiring the user<br>
	to provide a user name and password when logging in to an application. Multi-factor authentication requires more than one 
	form of authentication—the factors might include something you know (a password),<br>
	something you have (a mobile device), and something you are (a thumb print or facial recognition).
	<li><strong>Authorization </strong></li>
	After a user has been authenticated, the user may be authorized to access and use the application.
	The system can validate that a user has permission to access the application by comparing the user’s 
	identity with a list of authorized users. Authentication must happen before authorization <br>
	so that the application matches only validated user credentials to the authorized user list.
	<li><strong>Encryption</strong></li>
	After a user has been authenticated and is using the application, other security measures can protect sensitive data <br>
	from being seen or even used by a cybercriminal. In cloud-based applications,
	where traffic containing sensitive data travels between the end user and the cloud, that traffic can be encrypted to keep the data safe. 
	<li><strong>Logging</strong></li>
	If there is a security breach in an application, logging can help identify who got access to the data and how.<br>
	Application log files provide a time-stamped record of which aspects of the application were accessed and by whom. 
    <li><strong>Application security testing</strong></li>
	A necessary process to ensure that all of these security controls work properly.
</ol>
